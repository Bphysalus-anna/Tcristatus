# Spatial Prioritisation Map

The map highlights areas that were identified as suitable for conservation actions for the northern crested newt (<i>Triturus cristatus</i>) in Luxembourg. The spatial prioritisation of crested newt habitat management was based on a set of five criteria, informed by the results of the population genetics, landscape resistance, and habitat suitability analyses, and the scientific literature. The criteria consisted of 1) high habitat suitability, (2) close proximity to a pond with known crested newts occurrence, (3) high connectivity among identified areas, (4) less than 25% impervious surfaces, (5) a distance of at least 1km to the nearest motorway (Hamer et al., 2021). This prioritisation problem was solved using the PRIORITIZR R package (v.8.0.0; Hanson et al., 2023).

The full methodology is detailed in the study "Schleimer, A., Cant√∫-Salazar, L., Luttringer, A., Frantz, A. A multidisciplinary framework for spatial prioritisation in crested newt conservation: insights from population genetics and habitat suitability in Luxembourg." that is currently in peer review for publication.
